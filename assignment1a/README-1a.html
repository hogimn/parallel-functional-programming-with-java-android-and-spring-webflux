<h3>Image Crawler Stream App (Assignment 1a)</h3>

<p>The purpose of the first part of this two-part assignment is to
deepen your experience using Java functional programming features and
their integration with Java sequential streams.  In particular, in
this assignment you'll develop an app that uses Java sequential
streams to obtain, transform, and store images.</p>

<p> The code you'll write for this assignment has a GUI and runs as an
Android app. Please feel free to use this app to help debug your
solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>Good overviews of Java streams appear <A
HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams-2177646.html">here</A>
and <A
HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/architect-streams-pt2-2227132.html">here</A>. <P>

<li> The book <A
HREF="https://www.manning.com/books/modern-java-in-action">Modern Java
in Action</A> is a great resource to learn how to program Java
streams. </li> </ul>

<p>Naturally, we'll cover this material in class, which will be
available in my YouTube <A

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</A>.  This
app is written in both Kotlin and Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM>
Android capabilities.  For the purposes of Assignment 1a, however, you
only need to be aware of the following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which is a
set of unit tests that exercise the features you're implementing to
evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this assignment's
requirements.  </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests">app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests</A>,
which is an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 31, so you'll need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 31 (I recommend API 32). If you don't already have an Android
Emulator you can create one by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">imagecrawler/crawlers</A>
folder:

<UL>

<LI> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialStreamsCrawler.java">imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialStreamsCrawler.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to obtain,
transform, and store images.  This class uses Java sequential streams
to perform an "image crawl" starting from a root Uri.  Depending on
the parameters used to run the tests, images from HTML pages reachable
from the root Uri are either downloaded from a remote web server or
read from the local file system and the results are stored in the
local file system on the Android device. </p> 

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"><A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/Student.kt">Student.kt</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" to set the <CODE>type</CODE> field
to include just <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or <CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI>

</UL>

<p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.  In
fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features is provided in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java">SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</A>
file.  You will therefore focus on converting this Java 7-based class
to the <CODE>SequentialStreamsCrawler</CODE> class that uses Java
sequential streams.</p>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or if/else statements
in this assignment and instead use Java sequential stream aggregate
operations and functional programming features. Your solution will be
considered correct if it passes all the unit and instrumentation
tests, is commented thoroughly, and addresses my review comments.</p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is
available <a href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment1a/">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  Please setup
your <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account, pull this
skeleton code into your repository, read it carefully, and complete
the "TODO" markers.

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> The unit tests in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler">image-crawler/src/test</A>
folder are provided to increase our collective confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  You'll need to use the Android
Studio GUI to run the unit tests locally on your computer, as
described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</A>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 1a is designed to deepen your experience developing
apps using Java sequential streams and functional programming
features.  The skeletons and unit tests are quite extensive, though
you don't need to understand them all to complete your solution.
Please therefore start early and ask questions in class, office hours,
and on the discussion forums to ensure you complete this assignment
successfully! </p>
